<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval Settings: Sellers may set a Listing so that Seller approval is required for a Buyer to complete a Transaction. Such Listings must specify the timeframe within which approval or rejection of the Transaction must be provided by the Seller.

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sale Contract and Order Confirmation: Following Seller approval, if required, when a Buyer completes the sales process by entering their payment details and clicking on &ldquo;pay now&rdquo; for paid for Events or &ldquo;register&rdquo; for free Events, the parties shall become contractually bound to one another to complete the Transaction.

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval Settings: Some Listings may require the Seller&rsquo;s approval prior to the Buyer being able to purchase Tickets. Such Listings shall specify the timeframes within which approval must be given by the Seller. If no approval is granted within such timeframes, your order will be canceled and payment will not be taken.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order Confirmation: Upon Buyers completing their purchase, by entering their payment details, where necessary, and clicking &ldquo;pay now&rdquo; for paid for Events or &ldquo;register&rdquo; for free Events, an Order Confirmation shall automatically be issued to the Buyer, which is the point at which the Buyer and Seller enter into a binding agreement. The Order Confirmation will contain the Ticket with which the Buyer will be able to attend the Event. If the Order Confirmation is not received, it can be retrieved from the Account dashboard, along with the Ticket.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment: Once the Buyer receives the Order Confirmation, depending on which Payment Processing Method the Seller has selected, the Buyer agrees that WTF Where&rsquo;s The Fun or a third party payment processor, acting on behalf of the Seller, may debit or authorise the amount of the Transaction Value from the method of payment provided by the Buyer. If applicable, the Service Charge is non-refundable and, unless otherwise agreed by the Seller, no refunds or credits will be provided once the Buyer has been charged.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Ticket Terms and Conditions: All Tickets purchased by the Buyer are subject to the Ticket, Event and Venue terms and conditions, and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

WTF Where&rsquo;s The Fun does not investigate or otherwise ensure the factual accuracy of any donation claims made by Sellers in Listings.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Currency: WTF Where&rsquo;s The Fun provides a feature through which Users may view fees for various Listings in foreign currencies. Sale Prices listed in foreign currencies are for informational purposes only. You understand and agree that any such foreign currencies are not the official Sale Price and at the time you request a booking you will be notified of the currency in which you will be charged together with the corresponding Transaction Value. The value is payable in the currency specified at the time of checkout.</p>
<ul>
<li>CANCELLATION AND REFUNDS</li>
</ul>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation: The cancellation and refund policy for a Ticket is at the Seller&rsquo;s discretion and will be set out in the Listing description. If no such policy is set out by the Seller, Buyers may cancel a booking and receive a refund of the Sale Price, if requested 24 hours or more before the start time of the Event.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refunds: If a Buyer cancels a booking within the timeframe set out by the Seller if any, the Buyer may be refunded the Sale Price for such booking within a commercially reasonable amount of time, typically one week after a refund is agreed upon. Service Charges, if applicable to the Buyer, are non-refundable.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refund via PayPal Payment: If a Seller grants a Buyer a refund and PayPal Payment has been selected by the Seller, WTF Where&rsquo;s The Fun will refund the Sale Price paid by the Buyer for such booking within a commercially reasonable amount of time, typically one week after a refund is agreed upon.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refund via Stripe Payments: If a Seller grants a Buyer a refund and Stripe Payments has been selected by the Seller, the Buyer shall be refunded directly by the Seller. The Seller and the Buyer must arrange such a refund between themselves and WTF Where&rsquo;s The Fun shall have no responsibility or liability for any such refunds.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disputes: If a Seller fails to fulfill its obligations in relation to a Transaction, subject to the refund options a Seller has set out in the Listing, Buyers will have 48 hours from the start time of the Event to request a refund. If a Buyer requests a refund within this timeframe, WTF Where&rsquo;s The Fun will promptly notify the Seller. The Seller will have 48 hours to rebut such dispute, resulting in one of two scenarios: (i) if the Seller does not rebut such dispute, a full refund of the Sale Price will be given to the Buyer by the Seller; or (ii) if the Seller does rebut such dispute, the two parties must contact one another to resolve the dispute and submit the confirmation of the resolution to WTF Where&rsquo;s The Fun within 30 days. If no confirmation of resolution is received by WTF Where&rsquo;s The Fun within 30 days, WTF Where&rsquo;s The Fun will resolve the dispute in its sole and absolute discretion, which may include a decision to refund the Buyer and pursue the Seller for the refunded amount. It is the Seller&rsquo;s responsibility to provide proof that a Buyer was in attendance at an Event.</p>
